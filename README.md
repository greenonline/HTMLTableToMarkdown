# HTMLTableToMarkdown
Script to convert online HTML tables to Markdown tables

Change only the `url` and `print_cols` variables
  - for the URL and the columns to be included in the markdown tables, respectively
  - column numbering starts at zero (0), for the first column

#### Background

This script was initially developed to convert 3D printing filament empty spool weights tables (that were in HTML format) to Markdown format, for use with this question on Stack Exchange, [Is there a table or list of tare weights of empty spools of various manufacturers?](https://3dprinting.stackexchange.com/q/6558/4762) 

However, it should work for any online HTML table
